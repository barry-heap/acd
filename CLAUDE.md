# acd-tools — Claude Code Entry Point

This file is for AI agents (Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.) working **on this repository's own
source code** — i.e. maintaining/extending the ACD parser itself. For user-facing API docs
and usage examples, see `README.md` instead; this file is about internals, gotchas, and how
to safely make changes here.

## Purpose

`acd-tools` parses Rockwell `.ACD` project files (Studio 5000 / RSLogix 5000) directly from
their proprietary binary format — no Studio 5000 installation or L5X export required — and
exposes the contents as Python objects (`Controller`, `Tag`, `Program`, `Routine`, `DataType`,
`AOI`, `Module`, ...). It can also serialize the parsed project back to L5X XML, and patch
rung text back into a working `.ACD` file.

The `.ACD` file is a zip-like archive containing several proprietary binary databases:
`Comps.Dat` (all project objects: tags, datatypes, programs, modules, AOIs, ...),
`SbRegion.Dat` (ladder rung text), `Comments.Dat` (tag/element descriptions and comments),
`Nameless.Dat`, plus `QuickInfo.XML` / `TagInfo.XML` (some metadata is in ordinary XML).

## Commands

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                    # runs from repo root; test/conftest.py chdir's into test/ automatically
```

- Run a single test: `pytest test/test_elements_helpers.py -q`
- The sample fixture ACD used throughout the test suite is `resources/CuteLogix.ACD` (paths
  in test files are relative to `test/`, e.g. `"../resources/CuteLogix.ACD"` — this works from
  any invocation directory because of the `conftest.py` autouse fixture).
- Formatting: `black` (via pre-commit, see `.pre-commit-config.yaml`).

```

**Data flow:** `ExportL5x.__init__` unzips the ACD, reads each `.Dat` file via `DbExtract`,
runs each raw record through its `record/*.py` parser, and bulk-inserts the normalized tuples
into an in-memory-ish SQLite DB (`comps`, `rungs`, `region_map`, `comments`, `nameless` tables).
`ControllerBuilder` (in `elements.py`) then queries that SQLite DB to build the full object
graph. Builder classes (`TagBuilder`, `ProgramBuilder`, `DataTypeBuilder`, `AoiBuilder`, ...)
all follow the same pattern: take a cursor + `object_id`, `SELECT` the raw record, parse fixed
byte offsets out of it (via `struct.unpack_from`), and construct the corresponding dataclass.

**Everything is binary-offset-driven, not name-driven.** A new/unfamiliar UDT, tag, or AOI
needs zero code changes to parse correctly — `DataTypeBuilder`/`MemberBuilder` read `dimension`,
`data_type`, `bit_number`, etc. from fixed offsets in the raw record for every UDT, whatever
it's called. The **only** name-based heuristic anywhere in the parsing pipeline is in
`ControllerBuilder`'s I/O comment-resolution block (`elements.py`, search for `"FAULT", "STATUS"`)
which excludes members literally named `Fault`/`Status` when guessing which member of an I/O
module's UDT is "the data member" for legacy bit-comment resolution — scoped narrowly to that
one use case, not to tag/UDT typing in general.

## Comment / description resolution — read this before touching `comments.py` or `_comments`

This is the trickiest, most bug-prone part of the codebase. `Comments.Dat` stores per-tag and
per-element/per-bit descriptions (what Studio 5000 shows as `<Comment Operand="...">` in an
L5X, or the tag's `<Description>`). Getting the full address (`Tag[3].Flags.2`, `Tag.Member.Bit`,
`Local:10:I.Data.13`, etc.) right requires resolving several layers of indirection:

1. **Container key.** Each tag's comments are found via `parent = (comment_id << 16) | cip_type`,
   where `comment_id`/`cip_type` are read from the tag's own comps record (`RxGeneric`).
2. **Scope collisions.** Multiple *unrelated* tags can share the exact same `(comment_id,
   cip_type)` key (e.g. tags that never got their own unique `comment_id` assigned — this
   affected up to 435 tags in one real project). **`comments` table has a `scope_id` column**
   (a 2-byte discriminator at absolute byte offset 16 in both the tag's own raw record and every
   comment record) that must be matched in addition to `parent`, or comments from completely
   different tags get merged together and mislabeled. `TagBuilder` already does this — if you
   add any *new* query against the `comments` table, make sure to filter by `scope_id` too.
3. **Record types.** `Comments.Dat` uses several different binary record layouts depending on
   what's being described (see `record_type` handling in `acd/record/comments.py`):
   - `1`/`2` (AsciiRecord): whole-tag/whole-object descriptions and rung comments.
   - `3`/`4`/`13`/`14` (Kaitai `Utf16Record`): standard structured Kaitai-dispatched types.
   - `5`/`6`/`7`/`8`/`11`/`15`: array/bit operand descriptions with an identical hand-parsed
     layout (`unknown(8) + obj_id(u4) + unknown(4) + utf16 tag_ref + ascii text`) — **not**
     dispatched by the Kaitai `.ksy` file, parsed by hand in `comments.py`. If you find a new
     numbered type with this same byte shape, just add it to this tuple.
   - `16`/`17`: similar but with `obj_id` at a different offset (6, not 8).
   - `21`: same hand-parsed layout as 5/6/7/8/11/15, but its `tag_reference` can be a
     **double-chained** `!HEXOID1.!HEXOID2` reference (nested UDT member paths like
     `Tag.Member1.Member2`) — already handled correctly by the existing multi-match hex-OID
     regex once the record type is recognized.
   - `12`: UDI metadata (AOI RevisionNote) — different, unrelated layout.
4. **Hex-OID resolution.** References like `!06DC4E61` or `.!06DC4E61.!0751B500` are object IDs
   into `RxTypeMemberCollection`; `_build_hex_oid_map()` in `elements.py` resolves them to member
   names. This map is built **globally per-project**, not scoped to the specific tag's own
   DataType — a theoretical (not yet observed) risk if two unrelated members ever share an OID.
5. **Path normalization** (`TagBuilder.build()`, the `normalized = []` loop in `elements.py`):
   stitches the tag name + resolved ref into a final address string. Watch out for:
   - Refs that already carry their own leading `.` (from `.!HEXOID` resolution) — don't add a
     second dot (`sep = "" if ref.startswith(".") else "."`).
   - Multi-digit array indices — any regex touching bracket/digit patterns here (see
     `ExportL5x._normalize_comment`'s bare-`"N]"` → `"[N]"` fix) must use a lookbehind that
     excludes *both* `[` and digits, or it can match mid-way through a 2+-digit number and
     corrupt it (this was a real regression: `(?<!\[)` alone matched inside `"[10]"`, producing
     `"[1[0]"`).

**When verifying comment/description output, don't trust `ref.json`-style derived references
blindly** — it can have its own bugs. Prefer checking directly against a real Studio 5000
L5X/CSV export's `<Comment Operand="...">` / `COMMENT` rows, which is unambiguous ground truth.

## Known limitations / things not implemented

- `Comps.Dat` binary serialization is not implemented — `save_acd()`/`patch_rungs()` only
  re-serializes `SbRegion.Dat` (rung text); tags/datatypes/AOIs/modules round-trip as raw bytes.
- `acd/l5x/catalog_numbers.py` and `acd/l5x/port_structures.py` are hand-maintained lookup
  tables (vendor/product-type/product-code → catalog number / port layout) because that
  information isn't stored as strings in the ACD binary. Only relevant for **new hardware
  module models**, not new UDTs/tags/AOIs.
- Module (I/O) metadata is not fully round-tripped to L5X (opaque CIP identity records).

## Testing gotchas

- `test/conftest.py` chdir's into `test/` for the whole session — needed because many tests
  reference `resources/CuteLogix.ACD` via `"../resources/..."` relative paths. If you add a new
  test file, you can rely on cwd already being `test/`.
- Some AB module DataType names contain `:` (e.g. `CHANNEL_DI_TIMESTAMP:O:0`), which is invalid
  in Windows paths — anything that turns a comp name into a filename/directory (see
  `DumpCompsRecords` in `elements.py`) needs to sanitize it first.
- The full suite (`pytest` from repo root) should show `65 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed`. If you
  see `FileNotFoundError`s or `PermissionError`s across many unrelated test files, first check
  you're not missing the `conftest.py` chdir behavior or that a previous test crashed and left
  a locked SQLite file/build artifact behind.
