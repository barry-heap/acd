# acd-tools — Claude Code Entry Point

This file is for AI agents (Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.) working **on this repository's own
source code** — i.e. maintaining/extending the ACD parser itself. For user-facing API docs
and usage examples, see `README.md` instead; this file is about internals, gotchas, and how
to safely make changes here.

## Purpose

`acd-tools` parses Rockwell `.ACD` project files (Studio 5000 / RSLogix 5000) directly from
their proprietary binary format — no Studio 5000 installation or L5X export required — and
exposes the contents as Python objects (`Controller`, `Tag`, `Program`, `Routine`, `DataType`,
`AOI`, `Module`, ...). It can also serialize the parsed project back to L5X XML, and patch
rung text back into a working `.ACD` file.

The `.ACD` file is a zip-like archive containing several proprietary binary databases:
`Comps.Dat` (all project objects: tags, datatypes, programs, modules, AOIs, ...),
`SbRegion.Dat` (ladder rung text), `Comments.Dat` (tag/element descriptions and comments),
`Nameless.Dat`, plus `QuickInfo.XML` / `TagInfo.XML` (some metadata is in ordinary XML).

## Commands

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                    # runs from repo root; test/conftest.py chdir's into test/ automatically
```

- Run a single test: `pytest test/test_elements_helpers.py -q`
- The sample fixture ACD used throughout the test suite is `resources/CuteLogix.ACD` (paths
  in test files are relative to `test/`, e.g. `"../resources/CuteLogix.ACD"` — this works from
  any invocation directory because of the `conftest.py` autouse fixture).
- Formatting: `black` (via pre-commit, see `.pre-commit-config.yaml`).

```

**Data flow:** `ExportL5x.__init__` unzips the ACD, reads each `.Dat` file via `DbExtract`,
runs each raw record through its `record/*.py` parser, and bulk-inserts the normalized tuples
into an in-memory-ish SQLite DB (`comps`, `rungs`, `region_map`, `comments`, `nameless` tables).
`ControllerBuilder` (in `elements.py`) then queries that SQLite DB to build the full object
graph. Builder classes (`TagBuilder`, `ProgramBuilder`, `DataTypeBuilder`, `AoiBuilder`, ...)
all follow the same pattern: take a cursor + `object_id`, `SELECT` the raw record, parse fixed
byte offsets out of it (via `struct.unpack_from`), and construct the corresponding dataclass.

**Everything is binary-offset-driven, not name-driven.** A new/unfamiliar UDT, tag, or AOI
needs zero code changes to parse correctly — `DataTypeBuilder`/`MemberBuilder` read `dimension`,
`data_type`, `bit_number`, etc. from fixed offsets in the raw record for every UDT, whatever
it's called, including Rockwell "ProductDefined"/module-defined types and string-family types
(`STRING`, or a custom type like `STRING_20` detected via the `family` flag, never by matching
the type's own name — a type could just as easily be named `ASCII_TWENTY`). The **only**
name-based heuristics anywhere in the parsing pipeline are:
- `ControllerBuilder`'s I/O comment-resolution block (`elements.py`, search for `"FAULT",
  "STATUS"`), which excludes members literally named `Fault`/`Status` when guessing which
  member of an I/O module's UDT is "the data member" for legacy bit-comment resolution —
  scoped narrowly to that one use case, not to tag/UDT typing in general.
- `ModuleBuilder`'s connection-type name-heuristic fallback (see `_CONNECTION_TYPE_BY_CODE`),
  used only when a connection record's type-code byte is unrecognized or the record is too
  short — the primary path reads a real binary enum (see below), logging a warning when it
  falls back so unrecognized codes don't silently get mis-guessed.

**When you find a classification that currently has to guess from a name** (like the
connection-type heuristic did until it was replaced), look harder for a real discriminating
byte/flag before accepting the heuristic as final — see "Connection Type" below for the method
that worked, and consider adding a `log.warning()` (loguru, already used in this file) on the
fallback path so future unrecognized cases are visible instead of silently mis-guessed.

## Comment / description resolution — read this before touching `comments.py` or `_comments`

This is the trickiest, most bug-prone part of the codebase. `Comments.Dat` stores per-tag and
per-element/per-bit descriptions (what Studio 5000 shows as `<Comment Operand="...">` in an
L5X, or the tag's `<Description>`). Getting the full address (`Tag[3].Flags.2`, `Tag.Member.Bit`,
`Local:10:I.Data.13`, etc.) right requires resolving several layers of indirection:

1. **Container key.** Each tag's comments are found via `parent = (comment_id << 16) | cip_type`,
   where `comment_id`/`cip_type` are read from the tag's own comps record (`RxGeneric`).
2. **Scope collisions.** Multiple *unrelated* tags can share the exact same `(comment_id,
   cip_type)` key (e.g. tags that never got their own unique `comment_id` assigned — this can
   affect hundreds of tags in a single large project). **`comments` table has a `scope_id` column**
   (a 2-byte discriminator at absolute byte offset 16 in both the tag's own raw record and every
   comment record) that must be matched in addition to `parent`, or comments from completely
   different tags get merged together and mislabeled. `TagBuilder` already does this — if you
   add any *new* query against the `comments` table, make sure to filter by `scope_id` too.
3. **Record types.** `Comments.Dat` uses several different binary record layouts depending on
   what's being described (see `record_type` handling in `acd/record/comments.py`):
   - `1`/`2` (AsciiRecord): whole-tag/whole-object descriptions and rung comments.
   - `3`/`4`/`13`/`14` (Kaitai `Utf16Record`): standard structured Kaitai-dispatched types.
   - `5`/`6`/`7`/`8`/`11`/`15`/`19`/`24`/`29`/`30`/`37`/`39`: array/bit operand descriptions with
     an identical hand-parsed layout (`unknown(8, scope_id at [2:4]) + obj_id(u4 at [8:12]) +
     unknown(4) + utf16 tag_ref + ascii text`) — **not** dispatched by the Kaitai `.ksy` file,
     parsed by hand in `comments.py`. This list was built incrementally by finding real examples
     of each shape in an actual project and confirming the byte layout matched; if you find a
     new numbered type with this same byte shape (8-byte header, obj_id at offset 8), just add
     it to this tuple — don't assume the list above is exhaustive, more probably exist.
     `tag_reference` can be an arbitrarily long chain of `!HEXOID` references (one per nesting
     level) plus array indices (including multi-dimensional, comma-separated: `[2,2,1]`) and a
     trailing bit number, e.g. `"[1].!HEXOID1[1].!HEXOID2.9"` for
     `Tag[1].Member1[1].Member2.9` — already handled correctly by the existing multi-match
     hex-OID regex once the record type itself is recognized; no per-shape resolution logic
     needed, just recognize the type.
   - `19` is **overloaded**: most instances are genuine tag comments (as above), but some carry
     AOI edit-history metadata instead (a literal `tag_reference` of `"UDI_LAST_EDITED_BY"` with
     a username/computer string as the text, parallel to the `12`/`UDI_HISTORY` handling below).
     Verified these don't collide with any real tag's `(parent, scope_id)`, so no extra
     filtering was added — but re-check this if you ever see a `UDI_LAST_EDITED_BY` string leak
     into `Tag._comments`.
   - `16`/`17`: similar but with `obj_id` at a different offset (6, not 8).
   - `12`: UDI metadata (AOI RevisionNote) — different, unrelated layout.
4. **Hex-OID resolution.** References like `!06DC4E61` or `.!06DC4E61.!0751B500` are object IDs
   into `RxTypeMemberCollection`; `_build_hex_oid_map()` in `elements.py` resolves them to member
   names. This map is built **globally per-project**, not scoped to the specific tag's own
   DataType — a theoretical (not yet observed) risk if two unrelated members ever share an OID.
5. **Path normalization** (`TagBuilder.build()`, the `normalized = []` loop in `elements.py`):
   stitches the tag name + resolved ref into a final address string. Watch out for:
   - Refs that already carry their own leading `.` (from `.!HEXOID` resolution) — don't add a
     second dot (`sep = "" if ref.startswith(".") else "."`).
   - Multi-digit array indices — any regex touching bracket/digit patterns here (see
     `ExportL5x._normalize_comment`'s bare-`"N]"` → `"[N]"` fix) must use a lookbehind that
     excludes *both* `[` and digits, or it can match mid-way through a 2+-digit number and
     corrupt it (this was a real regression: `(?<!\[)` alone matched inside `"[10]"`, producing
     `"[1[0]"`).
   - Comma-separated multi-dimensional indices (`[2,2,1]`) — the same lookbehind must *also*
     exclude a comma, or it mis-fires on the last component of an already-correct index (`"1]"`
     preceded by `,` looks just like a bare missing-bracket case otherwise), corrupting
     `"[2,2,1]"` into `"[2,2,[1]"`.
   - String-family values (`STRING`, or a custom type like `STRING_20`) are represented
     identically at every nesting level — top-level tag, array element, or a member nested
     inside another struct — as `{"LEN": int, "DATA": str}`, rendered as a `Structure`/
     `StructureMember` with separate `LEN` (DINT) and `DATA` (ASCII) `DataValueMember`s. Never
     represent a string value as a bare/flat string internally — every consumer (XML rendering,
     comment-path matching for `.DATA[N]`/`.DATA[N].bit`) expects this dict shape, verified
     against a real non-blank custom string-family array tag. The `DATA` member's own text
     content is further wrapped as `<![CDATA['text']]>` (quoted L5K-style literal) when
     non-empty, or bare `<![CDATA[]]>` (no quotes) when empty — see `_string_literal_cdata()`.

6. **L5X `<Comments>` emission** (`_build_comments_xml()` in `elements.py`, called from
   `Tag.to_xml()`): renders every non-empty-path entry in `tag._comments` as a standalone
   `<Comments><Comment Operand="...">` block, positioned after `<Description>` and before
   `<Data>` — verified against a real project to be the correct position/shape. `Operand=` is
   the path with the tag name prefix stripped and the remainder **fully upper-cased** (e.g.
   `Operand=".GAIN"`, `Operand="[2,2,1].BFRPART.PART_MEMBER_04.3"`), even though member names keep
   their original casing everywhere else in the document. The comment text itself is **not**
   collapsed to one line the way `.description`/`<Description>` is — multi-line text is
   preserved as-is inside the CDATA. There used to be a second, separate mechanism
   (`_build_elem_comments`) that embedded `<Comment>` as an inline child of an array `<Element>`
   node; it was removed after confirming **zero** such occurrences in a real project's L5X —
   array-element/bit comments only ever appear in the standalone `<Comments>` block.
7. **AOI InOut-parameter binding metadata masquerading as a comment.** When a UDT member's
   DataType is itself an AOI (e.g. a `VFD` member typed as AOI `SAMPLE_AOI_05`), Rockwell
   records which of that AOI's InOut parameters is wired up using the *exact same* Comments.Dat
   record shape as a real per-element comment: the ref resolves to the whole member (e.g.
   `.VFD`), and the text is literally the AOI's own parameter name (e.g. `"Ethernet_Module"`).
   This is not a user-authored description — verified against a real project, the same text
   recurs identically across every tag instance of several different UDTs, regardless of the
   owning tag's own identity, and it never appears in Studio 5000's own L5X `<Comments>` output.
   `ControllerBuilder.build()` strips these (after `aois`/`data_types` are both available) with
   a narrow rule: a comment is dropped only if it's a whole-member reference (no bit/array
   suffix) **and** that member's own DataType is an AOI **and** the text exactly matches one of
   that AOI's own parameter names verbatim. If you ever see a real user comment go missing on an
   AOI-typed member, check whether it happens to collide with that AOI's parameter names first.

**When verifying comment/description output, don't trust any pre-built "reference" JSON/index
a downstream project might hand you** (e.g. something like `ref.json` derived from an L5X/CSV
by another script) **blindly** — it's typically hand-built by a separate AI/script pass and can
silently encode the very same bugs it's meant to catch. It may also not exist at all, or be
stale relative to the ACD you're actually testing against. The only trustworthy ground truth is
a real Studio 5000 export: an L5X's `<Comment Operand="...">` / `<Description>` elements, or a
Studio 5000 "Export Tags" CSV's `COMMENT`/`TAG` rows. Don't assume either is already present in
the working directory — if you need to verify comment/description output and don't have one,
ask the user to export a fresh L5X (File > Save As / Export) and/or tag CSV report from Studio
5000 for the specific ACD under test.

**Pitfalls when writing your own script to diff generated output against a real L5X** (all
caused three false "bugs" in one verification pass before being caught):
- `comp_name` is **not unique** in `Comps.Dat` — a `<Tag>` and a `<Routine>` (or other object)
  can share the exact same name. `SELECT ... WHERE comp_name=?` can silently grab the wrong
  object entirely. Always resolve by `object_id` (from the already-built `Controller`/`Program`
  object graph) or by `parent_id`/collection membership, never by name alone.
- Self-closing `<Tag Name="..." .../>` elements (e.g. Alias tags with no children) have no
  `</Tag>` to search for — a naive `content.index('</Tag>', start)` after matching `<Tag
  Name="...">` will walk past the self-close and grab the **next** tag's content instead. Match
  `(?:/>|>)` and branch on which one matched before searching for a closing tag.
- I/O tags (`":" in tag.name`) are already correctly excluded from the real `<Tags>` XML section
  via `Tag._l5x_exclude` — that exclusion only takes effect when a *parent* element serializes
  its `tags` list (see `_LIST_SECTION_NAMES`/`_l5x_exclude` handling in `L5xElement.to_xml()`).
  Calling `tag.to_xml()` directly on an I/O tag bypasses that filter and will make it look like
  I/O tags are wrongly emitting `<Tag>`/`<Comments>` content when they never actually would be
  in a real full-project export — filter by `not tag._l5x_exclude` first when spot-checking.

## Connection Type / RPI (Module builder)

`ModuleBuilder` reads each I/O connection's Type (Input/Output/DiagnosticInput/MotionSync/...)
from a real u16le CIP enum at raw offset 90, and its RPI (microseconds) from a u32le
immediately after it at offset 92 — not from the connection's name. The connection's own name
(e.g. `"Standard"`) gives **no reliable signal**: in a real project, most `"Standard"`
connections were `Type="Output"` while a couple were `Type="Input"`. If you ever need to
reverse-engineer a similar "guess from name" situation, the method that worked here: collect
every real `<Connection Name=... RPI=... Type=...>` from a project's own L5X export, match each
one to its raw ACD record (RPI is a convenient unique-ish key to match on), then scan every byte
offset for one whose value is constant within each `Type=` group and differs across groups — a
real 1-byte/2-byte enum will show up as a clean, zero-exception discriminator immediately.
`_CONNECTION_TYPE_BY_CODE` only has the codes seen so far (5/6/7/23); unrecognized codes log a
`log.warning()` and fall back to the old name heuristic rather than silently guessing — check
the logs if you ever suspect a module's connection Type is wrong.

## Known limitations / things not implemented

- `Comps.Dat` binary serialization is not implemented — `save_acd()`/`patch_rungs()` only
  re-serializes `SbRegion.Dat` (rung text); tags/datatypes/AOIs/modules round-trip as raw bytes.
- `acd/l5x/catalog_numbers.py` and `acd/l5x/port_structures.py` are hand-maintained lookup
  tables (vendor/product-type/product-code → catalog number / port layout) because that
  information isn't stored as strings in the ACD binary. Only relevant for **new hardware
  module models**, not new UDTs/tags/AOIs.
- Module (I/O) metadata is not fully round-tripped to L5X (opaque CIP identity records).
- **Module/Connection-level comments are not implemented at all.** Studio 5000 stores per-bit
  descriptions for I/O module connection points inside
  `<Module><Connections><Connection><InputTag>/<OutputTag><Comments>` (a completely different
  XML location from a regular `<Tag>`'s `<Comments>` block, with its own comment_id/scope_id
  resolution scheme that hasn't been reverse-engineered yet). Verified on one large real project:
  570 `<Comment Operand="...">` entries live there — 0 of them are currently emitted. This is
  separate from (and larger than) the regular per-`<Tag>` `<Comments>` block, which **is**
  implemented and was verified byte-exact against that same project (see comment-resolution
  section above).
- **Whole-project L5X fidelity has only been spot-checked, not fully verified.** A structural
  element-count comparison against one real project's own Studio 5000 L5X export
  (`<Tag>`/`<DataType>`/`<Module>`/`<AOI>`/`<Routine>`/`<Rung>`/`<Program>`/`<Comment
  Operand=`/`<Description>` counts) found `DataType` and `AddOnInstructionDefinition` counts
  match exactly, but `Tag` (+12), `Module` (+3), `Routine` (+9), `Program` (+1), `Rung` (-1), and
  `Description` (-40) do not, and none of these have been root-caused yet. These are being left
  as open items to resolve opportunistically (e.g. while implementing/verifying a specific
  routine or UDT export) rather than as a dedicated investigation — don't assume whole-project
  L5X output is byte-identical to a real Studio 5000 export just because a specific feature
  (like tag comments) was verified exact.
- `_decode_udt_initial_value`/`_decode_single_udt_element` (initial-*value* decoding from the
  data-table blob, `elements.py`) has a hardcoded recursion depth limit of 3 nested structs —
  this is a generic safety cap (not tied to any specific type/module), separate from the
  *structure*-generation recursion (`_struct_members_xml` and friends), which has no depth
  limit at all. If you ever see a deeply-nested UDT's initial value silently come back empty,
  check this limit first.
- ~~`<Description>` may need to preserve multi-line text~~ — **fixed.** Confirmed via a real
  Studio 5000 Import Routine diff: a tag's existing `<Description>` was genuinely multi-line
  (`"Program \nBit \nFlags"`, 3 lines), and our collapsed single-line rendering
  (`"Program  Bit  Flags"`) was flagged by Studio 5000's own import comparison as a real
  difference, not just cosmetic. `_multiline_xml_text()` now preserves line breaks in every
  `to_xml()` Description/RevisionNote renderer (Member, DataType, Tag, LocalTag, Parameter,
  Module, AOI) — verified byte-for-byte identical to the real export afterward. The
  `.description` **Python property** (`Member.description`/`Tag.description`) still
  deliberately collapses to one line — that's documented, existing convenience-API behavior,
  separate from XML fidelity.

## Partial/context L5X exports (`export_routine()`)

`export_routine()` (`acd/api.py`) exports a single routine as a standalone partial L5X file for
Studio 5000's native "Import Routine" feature, sidestepping the `save_acd()`/`patch_rungs()`
limitations entirely for the common case of editing/adding rungs (including rung comments) in
an existing routine — Studio 5000 itself handles all the internal consistency (cross-reference
index, object database, re-signing) that a raw binary write would otherwise require.

**Confirmed working end-to-end**: a real, edited `export_routine()` output (a routine with a new
rung instruction added, referencing one controller-scope and two program-scope tags, including
one array tag) was successfully imported into a real Studio 5000 project via native Import
Routine, with zero errors. This took several rounds of real-data verification to get right —
see below for the full list of bugs found and fixed along the way, most of which only surfaced
once an actual *import* (not just an export/shape comparison) was attempted:

1. **The wrapper shape** was calibrated against a real Studio 5000 "Export Routine" output (a
   2-rung routine referencing one controller-scope tag and two program-scope tags):
   `<DataTypes Use="Context">` (always present, even empty), `<Tags Use="Context">` at both
   Controller and Program scope (full `<Tag>` definitions, reusing `Tag.to_xml()`, for every tag
   the routine's rung text references — found via a simple identifier scan intersected against
   the project's known tag names, not a real ladder-logic parser), `<Programs Use="Context">`,
   and `<Routines Use="Context">` wrapping `<Routine Use="Target" ...>`.
2. **Program-scope tag shadowing.** A program-scope tag must shadow/exclude a same-named but
   unrelated controller-scope tag (standard Logix bare-name resolution) when resolving which
   tags a routine's rung text actually references — previously both were incorrectly included.
3. **THE actual crash root cause** (`0x80004003` "Invalid pointer" in Logix Designer, confirmed
   via the app's own fatal-error log): individual `<Tag>` elements must **never** carry a
   `Use=` attribute themselves — only the wrapping container elements (`<Controller
   Use="Context">`, `<Tags Use="Context">`, `<DataTypes Use="Context">`, `<Programs
   Use="Context">`, `<Routines Use="Context">`, `<Program Use="Context">`) and the routine
   actually being targeted (`<Routine Use="Target">`) do. This was found by the most reliable
   method available: making the identical edit directly in Studio 5000, exporting it natively,
   confirming *that* file imports successfully, then diffing our file against it
   attribute-by-attribute (not just child-element shape, which had already matched) — the one
   remaining difference was `Use="Context"` present on every `<Tag>` in ours, absent in the real
   one. This exactly explained every earlier experimental result: an empty `<Tags
   Use="Context"></Tags>` never crashed, but *any* populated `<Tag>` did, regardless of whether
   it was a scalar or array, regardless of whether it had `<Data>` content at all (even
   attributes-only `<Tag>` elements crashed) — because the bad attribute was on the Tag element
   itself in every case.
4. **Two more bugs found along the way, both affecting `Tag.to_xml()` generally (not specific to
   `export_routine()`)**, uncovered because building real context tags for this feature was the
   first time this session's verification touched a scalar-with-known-value tag and a real
   populated array tag: scalar primitive tags were missing their `<Data Format="L5K">` block
   entirely and used the wrong Decorated element shape (`<BOOL Name=...>` instead of `<DataValue
   DataType="BOOL"...>`), and primitive *array* tags were also missing their entire L5K block —
   see the "Rung patch write-back" section's sibling fixes below for `Tag.to_xml()` details, and
   the dedicated "BOOL array bit-packing" fix a few paragraphs down.
5. **Array trailing-zero truncation was removed entirely** (`Tag.to_xml()`'s primitive array
   branch and `_udt_array_to_xml`) — it was never actually verified against real Studio 5000
   output despite an existing docstring claiming otherwise, directly contradicted by a real
   Export Routine sample (a 256-element array shown in full, not truncated), and strongly
   suspected (though not proven, since fix #3 above turned out to be the actual root cause) as a
   contributing crash risk before that was found.
6. **A serious, unrelated data-correctness bug found while checking the imported tag's actual
   value against the project's live value**: BOOL *array* initial values were bit-unpacked
   incorrectly — see "BOOL array bit-packing" below. This affects every BOOL array tag's decoded
   value project-wide, not just `export_routine()`.

**Confirmed importing a real edit succeeds**: after fix #3, importing an `export_routine()` file
with a genuinely new rung instruction (referencing a controller-scope tag and two program-scope
tags, one an array) into a real Studio 5000 project completed with zero errors.

Verified against a **second**, more complex real routine (`PART_Skip`: 6 rungs, a UDT array tag
`SAMPLE_TAG_13[25]`, two Alias tags) by diffing against a real Studio 5000 export of the identical
routine, unmodified — 0 remaining differences (attributes and children) across every element.
This round found and fixed several more real gaps:
7. **`Routine._description`** — routines can have their own whole-routine description, rendered
   as a `<Description>` child of `<Routine>` before `<RLLContent>`, AND as a leading XML comment
   (`<!--description text-->`) right after the `<?xml ...?>` declaration in the partial-export
   wrapper. Root-caused via the comments table: the routine's own comment parent/scope_id key has
   an `AsciiRecord` (record_type=1) entry with `rung_content==0`, previously only understood as
   "internal metadata to exclude" — it's actually this description. See "Routine-level
   Description" below for the leading-XML-comment newline-doubling pitfall found along the way.
8. **UDT scalar/array tags were also missing their `<Data Format="L5K">` block** — same class of
   bug as the primitive scalar/array cases (fix #4 above), just not yet applied to UDTs. Verified
   against the real `SAMPLE_TAG_13[25]` tag. See "UDT L5K rendering" below.
9. **A latent bug this exposed**: a raw NUL byte could end up inside a decoded string member's
   own text (not just its computed padding), producing non-well-formed XML when rendered via L5K.
   Fixed `_l5k_string_padded()` to escape any embedded NUL the same way as padding (`"$00"`).
10. **`Member.byte_offset` leaked into L5X output** as an unintended `ByteOffset="..."` XML
    attribute (real Studio 5000 output never has this) — it was a plain, non-underscore dataclass
    field used only for internal UDT decode offset calculations, and `L5xElement.to_xml()`
    auto-serializes any non-underscore field. Renamed to `_byte_offset`.
11. **An Alias tag's target must also be included as its own context `<Tag>`** — a routine using
    alias `SAMPLE_ALIAS_02` (→ `SAMPLE_TAG_18`) needs the target tag's own full definition
    included too, even though the target's name never literally appears in the rung text (only
    the alias name does). Resolved iteratively in `export_routine()` (a target could itself be
    an alias) with the target name stripped of any trailing member/bit-index suffix.

Still open / not yet verified: whether the `Owner` attribute is actually required for import to
succeed (included as an optional parameter, omitted by default; both successful tests included
it, so its necessity hasn't been isolated), and scenarios beyond a single UDT array level
(nested UDTs within UDTs, AOI-typed members, multi-dimensional UDT arrays) haven't been
exercised through `export_routine()` specifically yet (though the underlying `_l5k_udt_literal`/
`_udt_scalar_to_xml` recursion has been separately verified for nested cases in other contexts).

## Routine-level Description (leading XML comment newline pitfall)

The leading `<!--description-->` XML comment `export_routine()` emits (see item 7 above) must
have its line endings normalized to bare `"\n"` *before* being embedded, using the same
`_multiline_xml_text()` already used for `<Description>` child elements — NOT the raw
`routine._description` string as-is. `Path.write_text()`'s default text-mode newline translation
on Windows blindly replaces every `"\n"` with `"\r\n"`, including the `"\n"` half of an
already-present `"\r\n"` pair from the ACD's own raw text, which doubles into `"\r\r\n"` (renders
as a spurious blank line) if left un-normalized. Caught by comparing byte-for-byte against a real
export where line breaks were single, not doubled.

## UDT L5K rendering (`_l5k_udt_literal`)

Mirrors `_udt_scalar_to_xml`'s own member-iteration rules (skip hidden and `BIT` members, same
declaration order) but emits an L5K array literal instead of XML: `"[1,0,0,...]"` for a scalar
struct, `"[[...],[...],...]"` for an array of structs, recursing into nested
structs/arrays/string-family members. Shares `_l5k_prim_literal()` (BOOL/BIT → `"2#0"`/`"2#1"`,
REAL/LREAL → `_l5k_real_literal()`, else plain decimal) with the primitive-array literal builder.
Verified against a real 25-element UDT array tag (`SAMPLE_TAG_13[25]`): every element's L5K literal
matches Studio 5000's own `<Data Format="L5K">` content exactly.

## Initial-value decoding offset bugs (`_read_tag_initial_value`)

Two separate, serious bugs were found here in the same investigation (verifying `export_routine()`
imports against a project's actual tag values) — both affected the decoded initial value of
primitive tags, one for arrays and one for scalars. **If you ever see a primitive tag's decoded
value look wrong, this function is the first place to check**, and don't trust a "looks
plausible" value without comparing against real Studio 5000 ground truth — both of these bugs
produced plausible-looking (but wrong) values for many tags before being caught.

**1. BOOL array bit-packing.** Every array element was read at its own naive per-element byte
offset (`offset + i * elem_size`). This is correct for every primitive type *except* BOOL/BIT
arrays, which Rockwell bit-packs 32 bits per 4-byte DWORD — the same packing `_get_type_size()`
already accounts for when *sizing* a `BOOL[N]` array (`ceil(N/32)*4`), but this function was
never updated to match, and silently returned a raw packed byte value (e.g. `32`) instead of the
correct `0`/`1` bit for every element of every BOOL array tag. Fixed by reading the correct DWORD
(`offset + (i // 32) * 4`) and extracting bit `i % 32` for BOOL/BIT arrays specifically. Verified
against a real 256-element array tag: all 256 values now match Studio 5000's own export exactly.
Covered by a synthetic unit test (`test_read_tag_initial_value_bool_array_bit_packing`) since the
small fixture has no BOOL array tags.

**2. Scalar offset was simply wrong (0x19E instead of 0x1A2).** This was caught as a *direct
follow-on* to fix #1 above, and turned out to be much bigger: after fixing the array case,
`SAMPLE_TAG_06` (a scalar BOOL) still decoded as `1` when the real project value is `0` (confirmed
consistently across two real Studio 5000 exports taken hours apart from an offline, unchanging
project copy). Root-caused by comparing raw bytes for `SAMPLE_TAG_06` against `Always_Off` (a tag
that by convention must always be `0`) — both shared an *identical* 419-byte boilerplate
data-table record, with byte `0x19E == 1` for **both**, proving `0x19E` was never actually each
tag's own value at all, just incidental template/boilerplate data that happens to often be
nonzero. Systematically verified against the real project: comparing all 758 controller-scope
scalar BOOL tags and 812 scalar DINT tags against Studio 5000's own values (from a real
full-project L5X export), the old offset (`0x19E`) matched only 21.4% (BOOL) / 2.8% (DINT) of the
time, while the array offset (`0x1A2`) matched **100% for both** — there was never a real
scalar/array distinction; `0x1A2` is simply where the data-table's value region always starts.
This affected the decoded initial value of every scalar primitive tag project-wide (BOOL, DINT,
REAL, etc.), not something specific to one tag or type. Fixed by removing the scalar/array offset
distinction entirely — always read from `0x1A2`. Covered by
`test_read_tag_initial_value_scalar_uses_0x1a2_offset` (a decoy-vs-real value at each offset in a
synthetic blob) plus a correction to `test_scalar_primitive_tag_xml_shape`'s own expected value,
which was itself a casualty of this bug (never independently verified against real ground truth
for the small fixture, just whatever the wrong offset happened to produce).

## Rung patch write-back (`patch_rungs`/`patch_sbregion_dat`)

This path (`acd/zip/write_dat.py`) had **zero test coverage** until it was manually exercised
against a real, large project and found to have two real bugs (both now fixed, with regression
tests in `test/test_patch_rungs.py`):

1. **Compression.** `patch_sbregion_dat()` used to return *decompressed* `SbRegion.Dat` bytes.
   `build_acd_bytes()`/`save_acd()` never compresses anything — it writes whatever is in
   `_raw_files` verbatim — so the patched file alone ballooned ~12x in a real project (1.08MB →
   13.8MB decompressed) and was stored as a plain, non-gzip stream while every other internal
   `.Dat`/`.Idx` file stays gzip-compressed. `patch_sbregion_dat()` now re-compresses before
   returning. Rockwell's own encoder was reverse-engineered by trial: `gzip.compress(data,
   compresslevel=1, mtime=0)` reproduces the **entire DEFLATE payload + CRC32 + ISIZE trailer
   byte-for-byte** against a real project's original `SbRegion.Dat` — the only remaining
   difference is the header's XFL/OS bytes (offsets 8-9 of the gzip stream), which are purely
   informational per RFC 1952 and don't affect decompression; they're patched to Rockwell's
   values anyway (`XFL=0x00`, `OS=0x0b`/NTFS) for a fully byte-identical no-op round-trip.
2. **Hex-ref formatting.** `_restore_tag_refs()` re-encoded `@HEX_OBJECT_ID@` tag-reference
   placeholders with `:X` (uppercase, no zero-padding). The real convention, verified by sampling
   20,710 real `@...@` refs in one project's `SbRegion.Dat`, is **exactly 8 hex digits,
   zero-padded, lowercase** (`:08x`), 0 of them uppercase. Using `:X` produced a
   numerically-equivalent but textually different reference, so even a true no-op patch (rung
   rewritten to its own existing text) silently produced different bytes.

With both fixes, a no-op patch (rewrite a rung to its own current text) now reproduces the
**exact original ACD container, byte-for-byte** — verified against both the small test fixture
(`test_patch_rungs.py`) and a large real-world project manually. This is the strongest available
confidence check for this write path, since it proves the full decompress → re-encode →
recompress cycle is lossless and matches Rockwell's own encoding conventions closely enough to
be indistinguishable from the source, without needing an actual Studio 5000 install to verify.

**Still unverified: whether a real, non-no-op edit (i.e. actually different rung text) produces
a file real Studio 5000 accepts.** Two separate open questions remain, neither resolved yet:
- Without a registered `FileInfo.Dat` signing key (see `acd/integrity/`), any mutation leaves
  the checksum stale; whether Studio 5000 actually enforces/checks this on open (as opposed to
  only the SDK) is untested.
- Even with a valid key, nobody has confirmed a `save_acd()`-produced, mutated ACD actually
  opens correctly in real Studio 5000 — that would require an actual test against the real
  software, which hasn't been done as of this writing.

## Testing gotchas

- `test/conftest.py` chdir's into `test/` for the whole session — needed because many tests
  reference `resources/CuteLogix.ACD` via `"../resources/..."` relative paths. If you add a new
  test file, you can rely on cwd already being `test/`.
- Some AB module DataType names contain `:` (e.g. `CHANNEL_DI_TIMESTAMP:O:0`), which is invalid
  in Windows paths — anything that turns a comp name into a filename/directory (see
  `DumpCompsRecords` in `elements.py`) needs to sanitize it first.
- The full suite (`pytest` from repo root) should show `68 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed`. If you
  see `FileNotFoundError`s or `PermissionError`s across many unrelated test files, first check
  you're not missing the `conftest.py` chdir behavior or that a previous test crashed and left
  a locked SQLite file/build artifact behind.
