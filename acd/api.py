    Unlike ConvertAcdToL5x (which serialises the whole project), this is
    meant to be imported into an *existing* Studio 5000 project via its
    native "Import Routine" feature -- Studio 5000 itself then handles all
    the internal consistency (cross-reference index, object database,
    re-signing) that a raw ACD binary write would otherwise require. This
    sidesteps the save_acd()/patch_rungs() limitations entirely for the
    common case of editing/adding rungs (including rung comments) in an
    already-existing routine.

    Verified against a real Studio 5000 "Export Routine" output (a 2-rung
    routine referencing a controller-scope tag and two program-scope tags):
    the wrapper needs, in order: an empty <DataTypes Use="Context"> section
    (present even when no custom UDTs are referenced), a <Tags Use="Context">
    section under <Controller> with the full <Tag> definition (current
    value, description, comments -- reusing Tag.to_xml()) of every
    controller-scope tag the routine's rung text references, a
    <Programs Use="Context"> wrapper (the plain <Programs> this used to
    emit was wrong -- missing Use="Context"), a per-program
    <Tags Use="Context"> section the same way for program-scope tags, and
    a <Routines Use="Context"> wrapper around <Routine Use="Target" ...>
    (both Use= attributes were previously missing entirely). ExportOptions
    for a partial/context export also differs from a full project export --
    it includes extra "References Context Dependencies" tokens.

    Referenced tags/data types are found with a simple identifier scan of
    the rung text intersected against the project's actual known tag names
    (see _referenced_tag_names) -- not a full ladder-logic parser, but
    correct for plain tag-name operands (which is what matters for
    instruction operands). Custom UDTs used by any referenced tag are
    included in <DataTypes Use="Context"> automatically, expanded to a full
    transitive closure (a UDT containing another project UDT, or an AOI
    parameter/local tag typed with a project UDT or a nested AOI, pulls in
    that dependency too -- see _resolve_type_closure()). AOI dependencies
    (a routine calling an AOI instruction, whose instance tag's data_type is
    the AOI's own name) are resolved the same way and emitted under
    <AddOnInstructionDefinitions Use="Context">, placed right after

    section's placement/shape IS now verified against a real Studio export
    (Motors/SAMPLE_ROUTINE_02, which calls AOI_SAMPLE_04 -- see CLAUDE.md "Native-

    I/O tag, e.g. "Local:12:I.Data.0" or a direct-addressed
    "SAMPLE_MODULE_03:I.OutputFreq") are resolved via _referenced_modules() and
